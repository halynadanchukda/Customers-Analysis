# Where Customers Come From and What They Buy?

This project explores customer behavior and purchasing patterns across 100+ countries using data on sessions, accounts, and orders.
It identifies top-performing markets, product categories, devices, and traffic channels, revealing how different types of users (registered vs unregistered) contribute to overall revenue.

Using SQL (BigQuery), Python, and Tableau, the analysis combines data transformation, descriptive analytics, and statistical testing (correlation and ANOVA) to uncover sales trends, weekly dynamics, and behavioral insights.
The results highlight clear seasonality, strong desktop dominance, and untapped potential in user registration and mobile channels.
