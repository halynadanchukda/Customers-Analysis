# Where Customers Come From and What They Buy?

This project analyzes where customers come from and what they buy, using data on sessions, accounts, and orders collected from 100+ countries.
The goal is to understand key sales drivers, evaluate user behavior across markets, and find opportunities for business growth.

With SQL (BigQuery), Python, and Tableau, I performed full-cycle analysis â€” from data extraction and cleaning to visualization and statistical testing.
The study covers market segmentation, sales patterns by continent, device, and traffic channel, and explores behavioral differences between registered and unregistered users.
Statistical methods such as correlation analysis and ANOVA were applied to measure relationships and test group differences.
